# Lengthy

## About
A very ~~satire~~ serious programming language

Lengthy is a very simple to use programming language. The only symbol is ðŸ™ƒ. To write code in lengthy, simply type ðŸ™ƒ repeatedly in a file. To compile, the number of ðŸ™ƒ are counted and this number is represented in binary then treated as machine code.

Lengthy has MANY advantages over traditional programming languages:
- Lengthy is easy to learn (no massive list of keywords and syntax rules, just ðŸ™ƒ)
- Lengthy is easy to read (no long confusing words, just ðŸ™ƒ
- Lengthy is ðŸš€blazingly fastðŸš€ to compile
- Compiled code is ðŸš€blazingly fastðŸš€ (Assuming you write your Lengthy code efficiently
- Any machine code can be decompiled into Lengthy very easy, so you can check compiled code for bugs using Lengthy
- Lengthy code runs with zero overhead costs, so is extremely efficient
- Lengthy has a simple to understand compilation process, so you know exactly what the resulting machine code will do
- The Lengthy compiler is extremely lightweight so has low hardware requirements

## Usage and documentation

To write some code in Lengthy, simply put loads of ðŸ™ƒ in your text editor, then run the compiler

Note that the source code file must ONLY contain ðŸ™ƒ, no other characters. Trailing whitespaces are permitted and are ignored

To run the compiler:
`python lengthy_compiler.py <source> <destination> -o`

- Replace `<source>` with the source code file
- Replace `<destination` with the name for the output file
- `-o` is optional, it means the compiler will output the compiled code to the standard output before it writes it to the file

If compiling for Windows, it is a good idea to give `<destination>` a `.exe` extension to make it executable
