# Lengthy

## About
A very ~~satire~~ serious programming language

Lengthy is a very simple to use programming language. The only symbol is ðŸ™ƒ. To write code in lengthy, simply type ðŸ™ƒ repeatedly in a file. To compile, the number of ðŸ™ƒ are counted and this number is represented in binary then treated as machine code.

Lengthy has MANY advantages over traditional programming languages:
- Lengthy is easy to learn (no massive list of keywords and syntax rules, just ðŸ™ƒ)
- Lengthy is easy to read (no long confusing words, just ðŸ™ƒ
- Lengthy is ðŸš€blazingly fastðŸš€ to compile
- Compiled code is ðŸš€blazingly fastðŸš€ (Assuming you write your Lengthy code efficiently
- Any machine code can be decompiled into Lengthy very easy, so you can check compiled code for bugs using Lengthy
- Lengthy code runs with zero overhead costs, so is extremely efficient
- Lengthy has a simple to understand compilation process, so you know exactly what the resulting machine code will do
- The Lengthy compiler is extremely lightweight so has low hardware requirements
- Easy to debug code because in a large codebase, you dont need to naviagate to the feature causing the bug, you can just add/remove emojis from the start

## Usage and documentation

To write some code in Lengthy, simply put loads of ðŸ™ƒ in your text editor, then run the compiler

Note that the source code file must ONLY contain ðŸ™ƒ, no other characters. Trailing whitespaces are permitted and are ignored

To run the compiler:
`python lengthy_compiler.py <source> <destination> -o`

- Replace `<source>` with the source code file
- Replace `<destination` with the name for the output file
- `-o` is optional, it means the compiler will output the compiled code to the standard output before it writes it to the file

If compiling for Windows, it is a good idea to give `<destination>` a `.exe` extension to make it executable


# Practicalities

The following would be the minimum number of emojis required to make an executable for each operating system (Based on data from ChatGPT)
- Windows - minimum exectuable size (PE) ~93B = 744b. Emoji count â‰ˆ 2^744 â‰ˆ 10^244
- Linux - minimum exectuable size (ELF) ~45B = 360b. Emoji count â‰ˆ 2^360 â‰ˆ 10^109
- MS DOS - minium executable size (COM) 1B = 8b. Emoji count = 2^8 = 256
- MacOS - minumum exectable size (Mach-O) ~4096B = 32768b. Emoji count = 2^32768 â‰ˆ 10^9865

In other words, unless you have more storage on your computer than there are atoms in the observable universe (~10^80), you can only write programs for MS DOS

For more context:
- Writing a Hellow World program in C and compiling with gcc and no extra options gave me a ~15kB file, i.e. ~10^37000 emojis
- [The smallest ELF Hello World program I could find](http://timelessname.com/elfbin/) is 142B, so 2^1136 â‰ˆ 10^342 emojis
- [This website](https://www.gnostice.com/nl_article.asp?id=225&t=The_Smallest_Hello_World_Program%E2%80%A6_At_20_Bytes) gives a 20B Hello World program usign a DOS command in Windows XP. Apparently the command was removed in Windows 7. 20B = 160b, i.e. 2^160 emojis â‰ˆ 10^49

ALthough this last one is signiicantly smaller, 10^49 is still an enormous amount of emojis. Assuming each emoji takes 2B of storage, this would mean the source code would be 2 * 10^49 B â‰ˆ 20,000PPPB (Peta-Peta-Peta bytes)

It may be a while until the average home user has that amount of storage

Lengthy is therefore a programming language well ahead of its time
